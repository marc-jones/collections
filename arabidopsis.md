RNA-Seq analysis of an apical meristem time series reveals a critical point in Arabidopsis thaliana flower initiation
=====================================================================================================================
Klepikova et al. 2015
---------------------
Grew Col-0 Arabidopsis thaliana under long days and sampled the shoot meristem from day 7 to day 16 at 1 day increments.

Synchronized the samples based on morphological markers such as the number and structure of leaves and flowers.

Looked at differential expression at each time point compared to the previous time point

Found 4 phases of their time series:
  1. Vegetative development:
    + FLC expression is decreasing and LFY expression is low
    + SVP expression is high and increases
    + SOC1 and FD expression increase
  2. Transition to flowering:
    + FLC and LFY expression are both low
    + Spike in differentially expressed genes; No new organs form so due to reprogramming of meristem
    + SOC1 expression decreases
    + SPL9 and SPL15 peak in expression at the start of the phase and start to increase at the end
  3. Activation of flowering:
    + LFY expression is increasing and FLC expression is low
    + SOC1, SPL4 and SPL5, SPL9 and SPL15 increase
    + Towards the end of the phase AP1 and CAL increase in expression
  4. Flower primordia initiation and development:
    + LFY expression is high and FLC expression is low
    + Spike in differentially expressed genes;  May be associated with the formation of floral primordia
    + Activation of genes involved in floral organ identity
    + Expression of AP3, PI and AG increase

Focussed on four groups of expression traces (Description; Enriched GO terms; phase):
  1. Peak expression during transition to flowering phase; ribosome biogenesis, histones, nucleosomes, chromatin modification and mRNA splicing; phase I
  2. Low expression at the start of transition to flowering phase then increase; biogenesis and structure of ribosomes and photosystems; phase I
  3. Lowest expression during transition to flowering phase; ATPase and nucleotide binding and helicases; phase II
  4. High expression at the start of transition to flowering phase then decrease; cytoskeleton, microtubules and kinesins; phase II

Attribute these changes to a burst of cell division which occurs in the shoot apical meristem at this stage.


Analysis of the Arabidopsis Shoot Meristem Transcriptome during Floral Transition Identifies Distinct Regulatory Patterns and a Leucine-Rich Repeat Protein That Promotes Flowering

Torti et al. 2012
-----------------
Grew Col-0 Arabidopsis thaliana under continuous short days, under short days with a period of long days and under continuous long days and used laser microdissection to look at the meristem specific transcriptome.

Found that five days of long day conditions were enough to commit the meristem to flower as if the plant had been grown under continuous long days.

SOC1 and FUL null mutants required a longer period of long days to induce flowering, with the double mutant requiring longer still, implying redundancy.

In wild type, SOC1 and FUL reduce in expression on return to short days when the plants have not been fully commited to flowering. When commited, SOC1 still decreases but FUL remains expressed, indicating that FUL is independent of long days once the plant is committed.

A null mutation in SVP is able to recover some of the effects of a SOC1 and FUL double null mutant, suggesting that SVP targets other than SOC1 and FUL are able to promote flowering in their absence.

SVP null mutation is more sensitive to long days than the wild type, and is able to restore long day sensitivity in the SOC1 and FUL double null mutant.

FT overexpression in the SOC1 and FUL double null mutant did not accelerate flowering, suggesting that the suppression of the double null mutant phenotype by a SVP null mutation is not due to FT expression.

Looked at gene expression change after a switch from short days to long days to try and identify other genes involved and did further analysis on six: FTM1-3, FLOR1, FAF2 and SPL4.

FLOR1, FTM2, FAF2 and SPL4 were not induced in the FT and TSF double null mutant after exposure to five long days, but FTM1 and FTM3 were.

The increase in expression of FLOR1, FTM2 and SPL4 to long days is dependent on SOC1 and FUL, but FTM3 is not.

An SVP null mutation in a FT-TSF or SOC1-FUL double null mutation background allows SPL4 induction in long days.

FAF2 expression was dependent on FT and TSF even in SVP triple null mutants. An SVP null mutation can overcome the requirement for SOC1 and FUL for activation of FAF2. Shows a stronger requirement for FT and TSF

FLOR1 seemed to show a higher dependency on SOC1 and FUL than FT and TSF in a SVP null mutant background.

FTM1 is associated with the switch from vegatative to reproductive growth rather than the shift from short to long days and is not dependent on FT expression.

FLOR1 promotes flowering and its role is partially redundant with SOC1 and FUL.


Gene coexpression patterns during early development of the native Arabidopsis reproductive meristem: novel candidate developmental regulators and patterns of functional redundancy
===================================================================================================================================================================================
Mantegazza et al. 2014
----------------------
Used laser microdissection to collect inflorescence meristems, floral meristems and stage-3 flowers from Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0.

GO term enrichment of the genes upregulated in the samples found floral development, cell differentiation and transcriptional regulation.

Found MADS-box family of transcription factors to be overrepresented in the sets of differentially expressed genes.

Homeobox and C2C2-YABBY families were overrepresented in stage-3 flowers relative to floral meristems indicating their involvement in the regulation of floral organ differentiation.

Clustered genes based on expression pattern across different tissues, and found similar GO terms as were found in the tissue comparisons.

Compared the results they found to those of a study where they induced AP1 expression and looked at gene expression changes.

Compared hierarchical clustering of expression traces to phylogenetic clustering of transcription factor families to investigate functional redundancies:
  + AP1 and CAL
  + AP3 and PI
  + BLH2 and BLH4
  + AGL19 and AGL20

Looked for functional regulatory circuits by clustering expression traces and looking for enrichment within these clusters of transcription factor families and transcription factor binding site in the promoter sequences. If a link due to transcription factors and due to expression correlation was found, a regulatory link was inferred.

Inflorescence meristem specific genes showed enrichment of MADS, AP2 and MYB transcription factor binding sites.

Floral meristem specific genes showed enrichment of MADS, AP2 and E2F binding sites.

Stage-3 flower specific genes showed co-occurance of two sets of transcription factor binding sites:
  + MADS, SBP and bHLH
  + HOMEOBOX and MADS

Provide evidence for differential expression of IDD family members during floral differentiation in Arabidopsis.
