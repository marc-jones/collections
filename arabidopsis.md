RNA-Seq analysis of an apical meristem time series reveals a critical point in Arabidopsis thaliana flower initiation
=====================================================================================================================
Klepikova et al. 2015
---------------------
Grew Col-0 Arabidopsis thaliana under long days and sampled the shoot meristem from day 7 to day 16 at 1 day increments.

Synchronized the samples based on morphological markers such as the number and structure of leaves and flowers.

Looked at differential expression at each time point compared to the previous time point

Found 4 phases of their time series:
  1. Vegetative development:
    + FLC expression is decreasing and LFY expression is low
    + SVP expression is high and increases
    + SOC1 and FD expression increase
  2. Transition to flowering:
    + FLC and LFY expression are both low
    + Spike in differentially expressed genes; No new organs form so due to reprogramming of meristem
    + SOC1 expression decreases
    + SPL9 and SPL15 peak in expression at the start of the phase and start to increase at the end
  3. Activation of flowering:
    + LFY expression is increasing and FLC expression is low
    + SOC1, SPL4 and SPL5, SPL9 and SPL15 increase
    + Towards the end of the phase AP1 and CAL increase in expression
  4. Flower primordia initiation and development:
    + LFY expression is high and FLC expression is low
    + Spike in differentially expressed genes;  May be associated with the formation of floral primordia
    + Activation of genes involved in floral organ identity
    + Expression of AP3, PI and AG increase

Focussed on four groups of expression traces (Description; Enriched GO terms; phase):
  1. Peak expression during transition to flowering phase; ribosome biogenesis, histones, nucleosomes, chromatin modification and mRNA splicing; phase I
  2. Low expression at the start of transition to flowering phase then increase; biogenesis and structure of ribosomes and photosystems; phase I
  3. Lowest expression during transition to flowering phase; ATPase and nucleotide binding and helicases; phase II
  4. High expression at the start of transition to flowering phase then decrease; cytoskeleton, microtubules and kinesins; phase II

Attribute these changes to a burst of cell division which occurs in the shoot apical meristem at this stage.
