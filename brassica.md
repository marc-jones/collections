A model of the phenological development of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.)
==================================================================================
Habekott√© 1997
--------------
Developed an empirical model to predict Brassica napus phenology.

Used just temperature data for the periods:
  + sowing to emergence
  + first open flower to end of flowering
  + end of flowering to maturity

Used temperature, vernalization and photoperiod to explain the period emergence to first open flower.


Delayed flowering time in Arabidopsis and Brassica rapa by the overexpression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) homologs isolated from Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L. ssp. pekinensis)
==================================================================================================================================================================================
Kim et al. 2007
---------------
Isolated three Brassica rapa FLC genes from Chiifu:
  + BrFLC1 (BrFLCA10)
  + BrFLC2 (BrFLCA2)
  + BrFLC3 (BrFLCA3a)

MADS-domain showed higher homology to Arabidopsis thaliana FLC gene than regions outside the MADS-domain.

BrFLCA10 and BrFLCA2 were found to be ubiquitously expressed in leaves, shoot tips and roots. BrFLCA3a was more lowly expressed than BrFLCA10 and BrFLCA2 in leaves and shoot tips and was not expressed in roots.

Compared an early flowering, an intermediate flowering and a late flowering Chinese cabbage. BrFLCA10 and BrFLCA2 were more highly expressed than BrFLCA3a in all lines. Expression of all three FLC genes was lower in the early flowering variety compared to the other two varieties before vernalization. Vernalization for 40 days caused a decrease in all three BrFLC genes in all varieties.

In transgenic experiments using Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica rapa, all three BrFLC genes cause a delay in flowering, with BrFLCA2 having the strongest effect.


Tuning growth cycles of Brassica crops via natural antisense transcripts of BrFLC
=================================================================================
Li et al. 2015
--------------
Found antisense transcripts of Brassica rapa FLC2.

Overexpression of the transcripts in Brassica rapa caused loss of vernalization and a conversion of biennial crop to annual.

Leaf number, branch number and seed yield were also affected by the transcript overexpression.


Quantitative trait loci for flowering time and morphological traits in multiple populations of Brassica rapa
============================================================================================================
Lou et al. 2007
---------------
Performed QTL analysis with three different populations:
  + F2/3 - Cross between rapid cycling line and a vegetable type Chinese cabbage line
  + DH-38 - Cross between oil type Yellow sarson line and a vegetable type Pak choi line
  + DH-30 - Cross between oil type Yellow sarson line and a vegetable type turnip line

Found eight flowering time QTLs identified using different populations. Of note:
  + *populations QTL was identified in; candidate gene co-localized with QTL*
  + F2/3, DH-38, DH-30; Brassica rapa FLC2
  + DH-30; LFY homologue
  + DH-38; Brassica rapa FLC1
  + DH-30; VRN2 homologue
  + F2/3; FT homologue

Strong correlations between different turnip traits and flowering time

Flowering time QTL were sensitive to environment. The QTL identified near Brassica rapa FLC2, which explained the largest percentage of the observed variation in some experiments, explained less of the variance after vernalization.
  
Co-localization of QTL for seed traits, growth-related traits, leaf traits, flowering time and turnip formation implies pleiotropy.


The Brassica rapa FLC homologue FLC2 is a key regulator of flowering time, identified through transcriptional co-expression networks
====================================================================================================================================
Xiao et al. 2013
----------------
Found that flowering time genes are preferentially retained in the Brassica rapa genome.

Used a population which was a cross between oil type Yellow sarson line and a vegetable type Pak choi line.

QTL near Brassica rapa FLC2 explains 33.5% of the observed variation in flowering time.

At the FLC2 (A2) locus, several eQTL were found for:
  + FT (Two copies on A7; trans; floral integrator)
  + SOC1 (A3 and A5; trans; floral integrator)
  + CO (A10; trans; cirdadean clock)
  + SRR1 (A2; cis; cirdadean clock)
  + TCP11 (A2; cis; cirdadean clock)

Found that the genes listed above as well as PI (A2; floral meristem gene) and PGI (A1; cirdadean clock) had expression levels which correlated with the flowering time phenotype.

Found eight eQTL hotspots associated with the expression of flowering time related genes.
