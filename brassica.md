A model of the phenological development of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.)
==================================================================================
Habekott√© 1997
--------------
Developed an empirical model to predict Brassica napus phenology.

Used just temperature data for the periods:
  + sowing to emergence
  + first open flower to end of flowering
  + end of flowering to maturity

Used temperature, vernalization and photoperiod to explain the period emergence to first open flower.


Tuning growth cycles of Brassica crops via natural antisense transcripts of BrFLC
=================================================================================
Li et al. 2015
--------------
Found antisense transcripts of Brassica rapa FLC2.

Overexpression of the transcripts in Brassica rapa caused loss of vernalization and a conversion of biennial crop to annual.

Leaf number, branch number and seed yield were also affected by the transcript overexpression.


Quantitative trait loci for flowering time and morphological traits in multiple populations of Brassica rapa
============================================================================================================
Lou et al. 2007
---------------
Performed QTL analysis with three different populations:
  + F2/3 - Cross between rapid cycling line and a vegetable type Chinese cabbage line
  + DH-38 - Cross between oil type Yellow sarson line and a vegetable type Pak choi line
  + DH-30 - Cross between oil type Yellow sarson line and a vegetable type turnip line

Found eight flowering time QTLs identified using different populations. Of note:
  + *populations QTL was identified in; candidate gene co-localized with QTL*
  + F2/3, DH-38, DH-30; Brassica rapa FLC2
  + DH-30; LFY homologue
  + DH-38; Brassica rapa FLC1
  + DH-30; VRN2 homologue
  + F2/3; FT homologue

Strong correlations between different turnip traits and flowering time

Flowering time QTL were sensitive to environment. The QTL identified near Brassica rapa FLC2, which explained the largest percentage of the observed variation in some experiments, explained less of the variance after vernalization.
  
Co-localization of QTL for seed traits, growth-related traits, leaf traits, flowering time and turnip formation implies pleiotropy.


The Brassica rapa FLC homologue FLC2 is a key regulator of flowering time, identified through transcriptional co-expression networks
====================================================================================================================================
Xiao et al. 2013
----------------
Found that flowering time genes are preferentially retained in the Brassica rapa genome.

Used a population which was a cross between oil type Yellow sarson line and a vegetable type Pak choi line.
