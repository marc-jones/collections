Tuning growth cycles of Brassica crops via natural antisense transcripts of BrFLC
=================================================================================
Li et al. 2015
--------------
Found antisense transcripts of Brassica rapa FLC2.
Overexpression of the transcripts in Brassica rapa caused loss of vernalization and a conversion of biennial crop to annual.
Leaf number, branch number and seed yield were also affected by the transcript overexpression.

A model of the phenological development of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.)

Habekott√© 1997
--------------
Developed an empirical model to predict Brassica napus phenology.
Used just temperature data for the periods:
  + sowing to emergence
  + first open flower to end of flowering
  + end of flowering to maturity.
Used temperature, vernalization and photoperiod to explain the period emergence to first open flower.
